    You are invited to participate in this research study run by the <b> Department of Economics </b> and <b> Professor Douglas Bernheim </b> at <b> Stanford University </b>. 
    </p>

    <p> This survey will take approximately <b> {{Constants.minutes}} minutes </b> to complete. </p>

    <p> 
        This study will pay you a HIT payment of {{Constants.hit}}. For completing the entire study, we will pay you a bonus of <b> {{Constants.cost}}  </b>. During the study you will participate in short tests on IQ, maths, and language ability. Good performance in these tests may increase your payoff further. In later parts of the study, you will further have the chance to earn extra bonus payments, depending on your choices and on luck.

        You will only be paid any bonus payments if you complete the full survey and pass all understanding and attention checks. You are allowed to withdraw from the study at any point of time. You do not have to complete any questions you are uncomfortable with.

    <p> <em> <b> About luck and randomness in economics studies: </b> </em> we guarantee, on behalf of the Department of Economics at Stanford University, that when we say that an event is random, it is truly random. When we say that the probability of an event is X%, then this event will happen X out of a 100 times, in expectation. The veracity of all information and instructions given in this study are guaranteed by the Economics Department at Stanford University as well as the IRB protocol under which this study runs (IRB-42264).

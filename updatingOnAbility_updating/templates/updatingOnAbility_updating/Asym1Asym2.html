<p>Firm 5 (ðŸŽ“ðŸŽ“ðŸŽ“ðŸŽ“ðŸŽ“ðŸŽ“ðŸ˜œðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±ðŸ˜±) consists of 6 <b>diligent</b> consultants, 1 <b>silly optimistic</b> consultant and 3 <b>silly pessimistic</b> consultants. </p>

<p>For either of Firm 4 and Firm 5, a positive report may either be truthful or not, and a negative report may either be truthful or not. Firm 4 is more likely to generate a positive report than Firm 5, but a positive report coming from Firm 4 is less likely to be truthful than Firm 5.</p>

<p>Suppose Firm 4 is hired and you receive a <b>positive</b> report from them, then how likely do you think that your Math score is among the top {{Constants.percentile}}%?</p>

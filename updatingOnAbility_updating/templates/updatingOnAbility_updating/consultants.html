If your Math score is not among the top {{Constants.percentile}}%, a clever consultant will always say "Your Math score was <b>not</b> among the top".
        </li>
        <li>
            A <b>silly optimistic</b> consultant (ðŸ˜œ) always say "Your Math score was among the top", no matter whether that is indeed true or not.

            A <b>silly pessimistic</b> consultant (ðŸ˜±) always say "Your Math score was <b>not</b> among the top", no matter whether that is indeed true or not.

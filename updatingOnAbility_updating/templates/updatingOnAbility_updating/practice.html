Practice with Signals and Advisors
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<p> On this page you can follow directly how the information you will see later is created! </p>

<p> Below, you see ten advisors - five clever advisors ðŸŽ“ (that always tell the truth), three silly optimistic advisors ðŸ˜œ (that always send a positive signal ðŸ˜ƒ), and two silly pessimistic advisors ðŸ˜± (that always give a bad signal â˜¹). Recall that the clever advisors will look at the true state of affairs (here we <b> show </b> you what that is below -- we won't do this later on!) and then send a signal that is the same as the state. In other words, they tell the truth. The two silly advisors do not tell the truth. They simply always send a good signal if they are optimistic and the bad signal if they are pessimistic. </p>

<p> When you click on the "Try it out!" button, one of the advisors will be randomly selected and will then send a signal.  </p>

<p> On this page we will show you which advisor was selected and what they say. In latter parts of the experiment, we will <b> not </b> show you what type of advisor was selected. We do this here so that you can practice your understanding of how signals are created.
</p>


<p> Your advisors for this practice round are:</p> 
 <p>
   <font size="6">ðŸŽ“ ðŸŽ“ ðŸŽ“ ðŸŽ“ ðŸŽ“</font> 
 </p>
  <p>
   <font size="6">ðŸ˜œ ðŸ˜œ ðŸ˜œ ðŸ˜± ðŸ˜±</font> 
 </p>
 
<button type="button"  id = "doButton">
Try it out!
</button>

<p>
 The true state of affairs is: <b id ="good"> good </b> <b id ="bad"> bad </b>  
</p>

<p> Your advisor in round <span id="roundNum1"> </span> is
<font size="6" id = "clever" >ðŸŽ“ </font> <font size="6" id = "sillyopt" >ðŸ˜œ </font> <font size="6" id = "sillypess" >ðŸ˜± </font>
</p>

<p>
 Your signal in round <span id="roundNum2"> </span> is hence:  <font size="6" id = "goodSig" >ðŸ˜ƒ </font>  <font size="6" id = "badSig" >â˜¹ </font> 
</p>

<p> <span id= "expltext"></span> </p>

<button id = "nextbutton">
Next
</button>
